Exempi
======
Python XMP Toolkit requires Exempi 2.0.2 which can be downloaded from
http://libopenraw.freedesktop.org/wiki/Exempi. To install Exempi, unpack the
distribution and run:

./configure
make
sudo make install

Note Exempi requires boost (http://www.boost.org/) to compile, and that on OS X
you probably need to run configure with one of the following options.

./configure --with-darwinports
./configure --with-fink 

Also, note that versions of Exempi prior to 2.0.2 does not compile on OS X.
