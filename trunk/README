Python XMP/AVM Toolkit is a library for working with XMP metadata, as well as
reading/writing XMP metadata stored in many different file formats. The
library further includes support for working with Astronomy Visualization
Metadata (AVM) â€“ a metadata standard for print-ready and screen ready
astronomical imagery based on XMP.

Python XMP/AVM Toolkit is wrapping Exempi (using ctypes), a C/C++ XMP library
based on Adobe XMP Toolkit, ensuring that future updates to the XMP standard
are easily incorporated into the library with a minimum amount of work.

Python XMP/AVM Toolkit has been developed by: 
 * ESA/Hubble - European Space Agency 
 * ESO - European Southern Observatory

Additional documentation is included in the docs/ directory in both HTML and
